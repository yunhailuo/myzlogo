# MYZL Logo environment

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/yunhailuo/myzlogo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

This is a toy environment for [Logo programming language](https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/index.html). It's built for my grade 1-2 kids. It's not a full implementation of Logo but designed to match the syntax kids said to have at their school.

## Project

This project is initiated and templated using Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

ANTLR4 Logo grammar is derived from <https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/logo/ucb-logo>
